# Face Mask Classifier
This machine learning project, is aim to train a model that could detect whether a person in an uploaded image is wearing a mask or not. I collected and trained the model using a dataset of images of people, some with masks and some without. The model learned to distinguish masked and unmasked faces, enabling real-time prediction of mask status when new images are provided.
